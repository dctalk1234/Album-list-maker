## Technical requirements: Excelling

## Creativity and Interface: Excelling
* I know you were struggling with the UI of this project, but the best way to go about this is to model it after a project that already exists. 
* your UX is a little funky, but this isn't a UIUX class, you incorporate sass again which definitely boosted you here!

## Code Quality: Excelling
* Please include a process.exit() in your seed.js otherwise the seeding will just hang after it's done

## Functionality: Excelling
Those three nested models are awesome! and no errors this is awesome!

## Planning / Process / Submission: Excelling
* would love to see all your errors documented in your readme! it's good to see where you've been and what you've solved. You can also create issues, and close them as you solve your bugs
